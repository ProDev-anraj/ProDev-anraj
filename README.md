👋 About Me
I’m a Platform Engineer with a passion for Kubernetes, Helm, Docker, and Cloud Security.
This portfolio documents my journey into MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) and AIOps (AI for IT Operations), combining DevOps, security, and AI to build scalable, secure, and intelligent platforms.

🎯 Career Roadmap
Here’s my learning & project roadmap, broken into phases:

    1.	Foundations (0–3m) → Kubernetes, Helm, Docker, Security (CKA, CKS).
    2.	AIOps (3–6m) → Observability, anomaly detection, predictive autoscaling.
    3.	ML Fundamentals (6–9m) → Python, scikit-learn, Andrew Ng specialization.
    4.	MLOps (9–15m) → MLflow, Kubeflow, CI/CD for ML models.
    5.	Production-Grade MLOps (15–24m) → Scaling with Ray, secure ML pipelines.
    6.	Leadership (24m+) → Architecting AI-driven platforms, OSS contributions.
